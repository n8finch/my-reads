## Getting started

1. Clone this repo.
2. Change into the repo and run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to build for development, and `npm run build` to run a production build.

## Structure

- All blocks code is in the `blocks` directory (not in a `src` directory).
- Most (all?) JS gets built to the `build` directory.
- PHP files are in `includes`
- Custom patterns are in `patterns`
- There is a sample CSV importing file that can be filled out and imported.
